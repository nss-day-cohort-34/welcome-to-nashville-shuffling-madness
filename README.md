Shuffling Madness Welcome to Nashville Itinerary

Project Status: In progress

This application is written in javaScript.

In this app you can search for four different things to do/visit in Nashville:
* parks -- using the Nashville [Metro Gov API](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.nashville.gov/xbru-cfzi)
* restaurants -- using the [Zomato API](https://developers.zomato.com/api)
* meetups -- using the [Eventbrite API](https://www.eventbrite.com/developer/v3/)
* concerts -- using the [Ticketmaster API](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/getting-started/)


When the you search for any of the four categories of things to do, the results should be listed in the DOM. Each result item should have an affordance to add the item to the current itinerary. 

Support: Google it and if that fails email Steve Brownlee.

Roadmap: Eventually we will have beautiful styling!
